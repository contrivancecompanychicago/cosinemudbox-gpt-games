## Games 🕹️

- **Pong Game**: The classic Pong you love, but with a twist – it's made in collaboration with an AI. Bet you didn't see that coming!
- **Mario-inspired Platformer**: Jump, dodge, and collect stars. And remember, every time you fall, somewhere in the cloud, an AI sheds a virtual tear. 🤖

And guess what? More games are on the horizon! Stay tuned for more AI-assisted gaming madness.

## Final Words 🎤

Why did the AI go on a date with a computer? Because it heard they had great "bytes". Okay, maybe I should leave the jokes to humans. Enjoy the games!
